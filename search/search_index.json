It uses React (a modern javascript library) to construct the checkout page. Compatible with Magento 2.3.4 and higher. What does it do? It loads a React Checkout at [store-url]/hyva/checkout . When enabled in hyva_checkout/general/enable it replaces the default checkout. It depends on these two variables in localStorage: signin_token to the customer section cartId to the cart section What are the benefits? In the default Luma theme in Magento 2, the checkout page is completely rendered using javascript. Unfortunately, the uiComponents are difficult to comprehend and developers are struggling when it comes to customize the checkout page. Also, the Luma checkout is too slow since it requires more than 400 javascript and template files needs to be download on the page load. In Hyv\u00e4 Checkout, the UI is constructed using React Components. This means, if you are familiar with the React, then the development is super fun and enjoyable. It is easy to bring any kind of customizations. It loads only a single javascript file in order to render the entire checkout page. So the checkout page loads fast and performs well. By default, the checkout works out of box. But, in most of the time you need to customize the checkout page to bring some custom functionalities or modifying existing checkout behaviour or change the look and feel. To make this tedious process simpler, you can launch the embedded ReactApp as a stand alone App and by providing a cartId, you can work on the checkout page exclusively. This development mode supports by Hot Module Reloading (HMR) which will enable us to see the changes we have been making on the code almost immediately reflect on the browser and that will eventually going to save a huge amount of time in the development. Where can we use it? Hyv\u00e4 Checkout can be used in any Luma based themes or with Hyv\u00e4 Theme directly. With some modifications, we can also use this with a headless approach too. In a Luma based theme You would encounter some CSS problems. This is because we are using Tailwind CSS for the styling of the checkout page and since this is a different CSS approach that is being used in the Luma theme, some CSS conflicts should be expected. In a headless approach There are some configurations we are passing through the data attribute via HTML DOM. This needs to be implemented in the headless approach to make it work there. Dependencies In order to use Hyv\u00e4 Checkout, you would require the following React knowledge. This is essential to work with Hyv\u00e4 Checkout as it is completely build with React. A magento 2 site with graphql API. Nodejs >= 10 is required in order to make it work. Technologies/ Terminologies Used The following technologies are used in the Hyv\u00e4 Checkout. React : React is used to build the UI. Tailwind CSS : This is used for styling the react components. Formik : This is used to store the checkout form states.A popular library in React realm.

Development Mode The ReactApp embedded inside Hyv\u00e4 Checkout allow us to launch it as a stand alone App. This is the best way of customizing Hyv\u00e4 Checkout for your site. When you launch the ReactApp, it will be served from the address http://localhost:3000 .

To setting up the development environment, follow the further steps. Where is the react app You can find the react app at src/reactapp . Setting up react app cd into the react application cd src/reactapp install the packages npm install Configure your Magento 2 backend site. There are basically two ways you can achieve this: 3.a - The cleanest approach is here. create .env file in src/reactapp directory and specify your site as shown below REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://your-m2-site.com CORS complaint from the browser One disadvantage you may face here is the complaint of CORS issue from browser. 3.b - A hacky trick would be specify your site as your proxy in the package.json . There is already an entry there. Replace it with yours \"proxy\": \"http://your-m2-site.com\", Use only one option above. Don't do both. There are some more configurations you can do using environment variables. You can find an example in env.example file.

The translations are prepared using a block Hyva\\Checkout\\Block\\CheckoutTranslator and passed over to the ReactApp via a global variable CHECKOUT_TRANSLATIONS . These would be picked up by the ReactApp and utilize it. Translation - The backend story Hyv\u00e4 Checkout uses layout XML update to include the checkout related translatable strings. File: src/view/frontend/layout/hyvacheckout_checkout_index.xml <block class=\"Hyva\\Checkout\\Block\\CheckoutTranslator\" name=\"checkout.translations\" template=\"Hyva_Checkout::translation.phtml\"> <arguments> <argument name=\"checkout_translations\" xsi:type=\"array\"> <item name=\"hyva_checkout_core\" xsi:type=\"string\"> <![CDATA[-- Please Select --,%1 zipcode: %1,%1 is required,...]]> </item> </argument> </arguments> </block> As you can see here Hyva\\Checkout\\Block\\CheckoutTranslator is responsible for doing the translation process. We are passing checkout_translations as an argument here and it will be an array. Finally, we are passing the core translatable strings through the group hyva_checkout_core here. File: src/view/frontend/templates/translation.phtml <script> var CHECKOUT_TRANSLATIONS = '<?= $block->getTranslations() ?>'; </script> Here we are passing the translation using a global javascript variable CHECKOUT_TRANSLATIONS to the frontend. So when you need to add more translatable strings through this, all you need to do is pass it through the layout update XML file. File: <your/layout/update/xml>/hyvacheckout_checkout_index.xml <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <page xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" layout=\"1column\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:View/Layout/etc/page_configuration.xsd\"> <body> <referenceContainer name=\"content\"> <referenceBlock name=\"checkout.translations\"> <arguments> <argument name=\"checkout_translations\" xsi:type=\"array\"> <item name=\"<unique_group_name_here>\" xsi:type=\"string\"> <![CDATA[your translations,goes here]]> </item> </argument> </arguments> </referenceBlock> </referenceContainer> </body> </page> Make sure to use a unique group name for your translations.

In this case, you need to include it like below \"first part of string, second part of string\" Translation - Frontend story There is a helper function __() available in the ReactApp similar to the translation facility in Magento 2 templates. You can find this helper function at src/reactapp/src/i18n/__.js . For an example, please see the PlaceOrder component. File: src/reactapp/src/components/PlaceOrder.jsx import React from 'react'; import { __ } from '../i18n'; function PlaceOrder() { return ( <div className=\"flex items-center justify-center h-24\"> <Button variant=\"warning\" big disable={!isValid} click={() => submitHandler(values)} > {__('Place Order')} </Button> </div> ); } export default PlaceOrder; see the import of the function __() and usage. It is that simple. Another job __() function does is, it accepts any number of parameters which will be replaced in the string at the right position. For example, if you want to print the string: My name is Julius Caesar . You can do this: const firstName = 'Julius'; const lastName = 'Caesar'; __('My name is %1 %1', firstName, lastName); In the string %1 part indicates it is the dynamic part and needs to be replaced with the other parameters passing to the __() . These parameters will be replaced in the %1 part in the given order.","title":"Internationalization"},{"location":"i18n/#internationalization","text":"Hyv\u00e4 Checkout uses Magento 2 translation feature under the hood.

For that, follow below steps. Install via composer composer config repositories.hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-checkout git git@github.com:hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-checkout.git composer require hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-checkout Enable module bin/magento setup:upgrade Apply theme specific changes (if any). You can find more details of this further down. Customization Steps In almost all cases, you need to customize the checkout. When it comes to customizing Hyv\u00e4 Checkout, you can basically take three approaches which is given below. The recommended way of customizing Hvy\u00e4 Checkout would be using the Magento2 Checkout Example Template . In this approach, you are keeping the Hyv\u00e4 Checkout as a composer dependency and never touches it. The customization is done via another module which you setup at app/code/ directory using the template given above. In a nutshell, this template includes a custom webpack configuration which enables you to copy over the React Components you really need to alter. This way, the customization will be kept differently and thus eventually it would be easy for you to upgrade Hyv\u00e4 Checkout and adopt the changes into your customization if needed. Another approach would be to fork the original Hyv\u00e4 Checkout repository and use the forked version in your site. This way, you can keep and versioning the customization you are making in that forked repository. Another approach would be setting up Hyv\u00e4 Checkout inside app/code directory. To do this, you need to create the directory app/code/Hyva/Checkout and then copy the content of src/ directory of Hyv\u00e4 Checkout module over there. This will also allow you to track the customizations. Configuration Once the module is available in your site, you can see the checkout page at the url [store-url]/hyva/checkout . If you want to make Hyv\u00e4 Checkout as your default checkout solution, then enable the below configuration in the Magento2 Backend: HYVA THEMES->Checkout->General Settings->Enable The configuration path is hyva_checkout/general/enable Additional Steps - Hyv\u00e4 Themes Both Hyv\u00e4 Themes and Hyv\u00e4 Checkout use TailwindCSS for styling. In a Hyv\u00e4 Themes based site, it does not make sense to include Hyva_Checkout::css/styles.css stylesheet because of the following reasons. It adds an additional style sheet in the site. One more style sheet means one more render-blocking resource in the browser. The style sheet holds lot of duplicated styles since both using the TailwindCSS. Due to these reasons, it is better to add Hyv\u00e4 Checkout styled components in the TailwindCSS purge directory list of your Hyv\u00e4 Themes based site. You can find more details of this in the official documentation of Hyv\u00e4 Themes: Tailwind Purging settings Below is the bare minimum steps you need to do in order to achieve it. You need to setup a child theme in your site. It should be inherited from Hyva/default theme. For the sake of simplicity, I am calling this child theme as Hyva/custom . Copy over the web directory from vendor/hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme/web/ to your own theme app/design/frontend/Hyva/custom/web/ Edit the tailwind.config.js file inside your theme and add following lines inside purge directory list. module.exports = { ... purge: { content: [ ... // Hyva checkout components '../../../../../../../vendor/hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-checkout/src/reactapp/src/**/*.jsx', '../../../../../../../vendor/hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-checkout/src/view/frontend/templates/react-container.phtml', ... ] } } ... With these changes in place, Hyv\u00e4 Checkout styles will be also considered by your theme and thus you will see a stylized checkout page in your store. Additional Steps - Luma Theme For Luma theme based site, Hyv\u00e4 Checkout module works out of box. This is because the stylesheet responsible for the Hyv\u00e4 Checkout styles Hyva_Checkout::css/styles.css is already included through a layout update. In a Luma based theme You would encounter some CSS problems. This is because we are using Tailwind CSS for the styling of the checkout page and since this is a different CSS approach that is being used in the Luma theme, some CSS conflicts should be expected. Additional Steps - Headless Solutions You are required to include the stylesheet Hyva_Checkout::css/styles.css and the js file Hyva_Checkout::js/react-checkout.js in your checkout page. These two static resources are already included through layout update. But, if your headless solution does not respect the layout update, then it is your job to include them in your checkout page. You need to pass the checkout related configurations (from Magento 2 backend) to the ReactApp. This is currently managed through data attributes in the below HTML DOM element. File: src/view/frontend/templates/react-container.phtml <div id=\"react-checkout\" data-base_url=\"<?= $block->getBaseUrl() ?>\" data-static_file_path=\"<?= $block->getViewFileUrl('Hyva_Checkout/js') ?>\" data-checkout_config=\"<?= $escaper->escapeHtmlAttr($configProvider->getConfig()) ?>\" > Same thing you should do in your headless approach.

We don't have any plans to keep payment components as part of Hyv\u00e4 Checkout. But we will be maintaining separate payment repositories which will hold the custom payment method components which you can use with Hyv\u00e4 Checkout seamlessly. Below, we are listing the payment repositories, and each repository will have specific instructions about its usage. hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-checkout-payone hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-checkout-paypal-express We are open to contributions here as the payment options available out there are many, and you all can help out to grow the above list. Payment Configurations and Its Usage Depending upon the payment methods, you may have some special configuration settings in your store. Usually, you do this under Stores > Configuration . If you are familiar with the default Magento 2 checkout page, then you may know that Magento 2 passes this configuration via a global variable which you can find at window.checkoutConfig . To collect these checkout configurations, we have a ViewModel ( Hyva\\Checkout\\ViewModel\\CheckoutConfigProvider ) available in the module and we are passing this configuration through the root DOM element. See the layout file where we injecting the view model. File: src/view/frontend/layout/hyvacheckout_checkout_index.xml <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <page xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" layout=\"1column\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:View/Layout/etc/page_configuration.xsd\"> ... <body> <referenceContainer name=\"content\"> <block name=\"checkout.container\" cacheable=\"false\" template=\"Hyva_Checkout::react-container.phtml\"> <arguments> <argument name=\"checkout_config_provider\" xsi:type=\"object\">Hyva\\Checkout\\ViewModel\\CheckoutConfigProvider</argument> </arguments> </block> </referenceContainer> ... </body> </page> See the data attribute data-checkout_configuration through which we are passing this configuration.

Custom Payment Renderer As already stated, by default, all payment methods appear as a radio input. But Hyv\u00e4 Checkout allows using a custom renderer for any payment methods. You can either develop your own custom payment renderer within the reactapp or use an existing custom payment renderer repo within Hyv\u00e4 Checkout. How To Create My Own Custom Payment Renderer Lets say we want to create a custom payment renderer for paypal-express solution. This is how you do this in Hyv\u00e4 Checkout. Create following folders/ files in src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods/ | |____paypalExpress/ | |____renderers.js | |____src/components/PaypalExpress.jsx You need at least two files in order to properly create a custom payment renderer. The custom payment render component. This is a react component. This react component will be used to render the payment method. In the shown example src/components/PaypalExpress.jsx is what out custom payment renderer component. renderers.js file that configures the payment renderer component. The content of this file somewhat looks like below File: src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods/paypalExpress/renderers.js import PaypalExpress from './src/components/PaypalExpress'; export default { paypal_express: PaypalExpress, }; So it exports an object. Each key specifies the payment method code ( paypal_express ) and its value is the custom payment render component ( PaypalExpress ). How To Use A Custom Payment Renderer Repo With Hyv\u00e4 Checkout You need to specify your custom payment repo in the package.json file as shown below: File: src/reactapp/package.json \"config\": { \"paymentMethodsRepo\": { \"payone\": \"git@github.com:hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-checkout-payone.git\" } }, As you can see above, we are configuring payone custom payment solution under config.paymentMethodsRepo . With this change in your package.json and if you run npm install , then your repo will be cloned into src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods directory and properly configured over there. How Custom Payment Renderer Works It all starts from the react component <PaymentMethod /> . This component is responsible for showing the entire payment method section. See its implementation File: src/reactapp/src/components/paymentMethod/PaymentMethod.jsx import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; ... import getCustomRenderers from '../../paymentMethods/customRenderers'; function PaymentMethod() { const [renderers, setRenderers] = useState({}); ... // collect custom renderers from the custom payment methods installed. useEffect(() => { (async () => { const availableRenderers = await getCustomRenderers(); setRenderers(availableRenderers); })(); }, []); return ( <PaymentMethodFormManager> <Card> <Header>{__('Payment Methods')}</Header> ... <PaymentMethodList methodRenderers={renderers} /> ... </Card> </PaymentMethodFormManager> ); } export default PaymentMethod; Here renderers state holds the custom payment renderers. This value is an object where its keys will be payment method code and values will be renderer component. renderers state is then passing to <PaymentMethodList /> component. This component will loop through each payment method and if a custom payment renderer defined for a payment, then it will use that custom payment renderer for that payment method; else, it will render the payment method as radio button (default behaviour). In the useEffect above, it is fetching the custom renderers. This is collecting from customRenderers.js File: src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods/customRenderers.js export default async function getCustomRenderers() { const paymentMethodRenderers = await paymentFetcher.fetchDataFromPaymentMethods( 'renderers.js', [] ); return paymentMethodRenderers.reduce( (renderers, item) => ({ ...renderers, ...item }), {} ); } Here it loops through available payment methods and dynamically fetching the renderers.js file inside each payment method. Then merge them together to get the final custom payment renderers available. How Custom Payment Renderer Interacts on Place Order Action If your payment method needs to alter the behaviour of place order action, then Hyv\u00e4 Checkout provides some features out of the box to help you out. File: src/reactapp/src/context/Form/CheckoutFormProvider.jsx ... function CheckoutFormProvider({ children }) { ... const [paymentActionList, setPaymentActions] = useState({}); ... const registerPaymentAction = useCallback( (paymentMethodCode, paymentMethodAction) => { setPaymentActions(actions => ({ ...actions, [paymentMethodCode]: paymentMethodAction, })); }, [setPaymentActions] ); ... } ... Here CheckoutFormProvider is one of the super parent components that wraps react app. As you can see in the code it has a state paymentActionList which can be populated with any custom payment action you want to perform when the \"place order\" action happens. See the registerPaymentAction function. This function is available for all the child components and thus a custom payment method component can use it to register a custom \"place order\" behaviour. Suppose you have a custom payment method component PayOneCreditCard and it looks like below function PayOneCreditCard({ method, selected, actions }) { const { registerPaymentAction } = useCheckoutFormContext(); // custom \"place order\" submit action const paymentSubmitHandler = useCallback( async values => { console.log({ values }); alert('yeeeha'); }, [] ); // registering custom \"place order\" action for the payment method useEffect(() => { registerPaymentAction('payone_creditcard', paymentSubmitHandler); }, [registerPaymentAction, paymentSubmitHandler]); return ( // custom payment method JSX here ); } So in the useEffect , we are registering custom place order action for the payment method. Now when the user opted payone_creditcard as the payment option and then click on the \"Place Order\" button, it will use the paymentSubmitHandler in this component to process the order. So now the payment method needs to convert the quote to order according to its need and then redirect the user to the success page. Custom Payment Method Best Practices Define dedicated custom hooks for accessing global states such as App , Cart or Form within the payment method itself. There are hooks available in other places to get the global state. But, it is always better stay away from those custom hooks and define and use dedicated custom hooks within the payment method. So if you want to get an App action such as setPageLoader within your payment method, then your can do the following to retrieve it. File: src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods/<yourPaymentMethod>/src/hooks/usePayOneAppContext.js import { useContext } from 'react'; import AppContext from '../../../../context/App/AppContext'; export default function usePayOneAppContext() { const [, { setPageLoader }] = useContext(AppContext); return { setPageLoader, }; } Now use usePayOneAppContext hook inside your yourPaymentMethod . Define your custom API methods within the payment method itself. Hyv\u00e4 Checkout holds all of its api methods inside src/reactapp/src/api/ directory. The components does not use any api methods defined here directly. Instead we are passing them through AppContext or CartContext . So if an API method needed in your payment method is already defined in the app, then access them through the corresponding context and use it with your payment method. But in some cases, your payment method needs to use its own custom api methods. In this case, it should be defined inside src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods/<yourPaymentMethod>/src/api/ directory. When you define your custom API methods, it will be good to follow the conventions we already using in src/reactapp/src/api/ . You can use your custom API methods directly inside the components. No need to setup a context and passing the api method through that context. But if your payment method is so complicated and you need a context layer to manage it effectively, then feel free to adopt that approach too.","title":"Payment Integration"},{"location":"payment-integration/#payment-integration","text":"In Hyv\u00e4 Checkout, the payment options will be shown as radio inputs by default.

See its implementation File: src/reactapp/src/components/paymentMethod/PaymentMethod.jsx import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; ... import getCustomRenderers from '../../paymentMethods/customRenderers'; function PaymentMethod() { const [renderers, setRenderers] = useState({}); ... // collect custom renderers from the custom payment methods installed. useEffect(() => { (async () => { const availableRenderers = await getCustomRenderers(); setRenderers(availableRenderers); })(); }, []); return ( <PaymentMethodFormManager> <Card> <Header>{__('Payment Methods')}</Header> ... <PaymentMethodList methodRenderers={renderers} /> ... </Card> </PaymentMethodFormManager> ); } export default PaymentMethod; Here renderers state holds the custom payment renderers. This value is an object where its keys will be payment method code and values will be renderer component. renderers state is then passing to <PaymentMethodList /> component. This component will loop through each payment method and if a custom payment renderer defined for a payment, then it will use that custom payment renderer for that payment method; else, it will render the payment method as radio button (default behaviour). In the useEffect above, it is fetching the custom renderers. This is collecting from customRenderers.js File: src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods/customRenderers.js export default async function getCustomRenderers() { const paymentMethodRenderers = await paymentFetcher.fetchDataFromPaymentMethods( 'renderers.js', [] ); return paymentMethodRenderers.reduce( (renderers, item) => ({ ...renderers, ...item }), {} ); } Here it loops through available payment methods and dynamically fetching the renderers.js file inside each payment method. Then merge them together to get the final custom payment renderers available.","title":"How Custom Payment Renderer Works"},{"location":"payment-integration/#how-custom-payment-renderer-interacts-on-place-order-action","text":"If your payment method needs to alter the behaviour of place order action, then Hyv\u00e4 Checkout provides some features out of the box to help you out. File: src/reactapp/src/context/Form/CheckoutFormProvider.jsx ... function CheckoutFormProvider({ children }) { ... const [paymentActionList, setPaymentActions] = useState({}); ... const registerPaymentAction = useCallback( (paymentMethodCode, paymentMethodAction) => { setPaymentActions(actions => ({ ...actions, [paymentMethodCode]: paymentMethodAction, })); }, [setPaymentActions] ); ... } ... Here CheckoutFormProvider is one of the super parent components that wraps react app. As you can see in the code it has a state paymentActionList which can be populated with any custom payment action you want to perform when the \"place order\" action happens. See the registerPaymentAction function. This function is available for all the child components and thus a custom payment method component can use it to register a custom \"place order\" behaviour. Suppose you have a custom payment method component PayOneCreditCard and it looks like below function PayOneCreditCard({ method, selected, actions }) { const { registerPaymentAction } = useCheckoutFormContext(); // custom \"place order\" submit action const paymentSubmitHandler = useCallback( async values => { console.log({ values }); alert('yeeeha'); }, [] ); // registering custom \"place order\" action for the payment method useEffect(() => { registerPaymentAction('payone_creditcard', paymentSubmitHandler); }, [registerPaymentAction, paymentSubmitHandler]); return ( // custom payment method JSX here ); } So in the useEffect , we are registering custom place order action for the payment method. Now when the user opted payone_creditcard as the payment option and then click on the \"Place Order\" button, it will use the paymentSubmitHandler in this component to process the order. So now the payment method needs to convert the quote to order according to its need and then redirect the user to the success page.","title":"How Custom Payment Renderer Interacts on Place Order Action"},{"location":"payment-integration/#custom-payment-method-best-practices","text":"Define dedicated custom hooks for accessing global states such as App , Cart or Form within the payment method itself. There are hooks available in other places to get the global state. But, it is always better stay away from those custom hooks and define and use dedicated custom hooks within the payment method. So if you want to get an App action such as setPageLoader within your payment method, then your can do the following to retrieve it. File: src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods/<yourPaymentMethod>/src/hooks/usePayOneAppContext.js import { useContext } from 'react'; import AppContext from '../../../../context/App/AppContext'; export default function usePayOneAppContext() { const [, { setPageLoader }] = useContext(AppContext); return { setPageLoader, }; } Now use usePayOneAppContext hook inside your yourPaymentMethod . Define your custom API methods within the payment method itself. Hyv\u00e4 Checkout holds all of its api methods inside src/reactapp/src/api/ directory. The components does not use any api methods defined here directly. Instead we are passing them through AppContext or CartContext . So if an API method needed in your payment method is already defined in the app, then access them through the corresponding context and use it with your payment method. But in some cases, your payment method needs to use its own custom api methods. In this case, it should be defined inside src/reactapp/src/paymentMethods/<yourPaymentMethod>/src/api/ directory. When you define your custom API methods, it will be good to follow the conventions we already using in src/reactapp/src/api/ . You can use your custom API methods directly inside the components. No need to setup a context and passing the api method through that context. But if your payment method is so complicated and you need a context layer to manage it effectively, then feel free to adopt that approach too.","title":"Custom Payment Method Best Practices"}]}
