# Hyvä Themes - React Checkout

A Highly Customizable Checkout for Magento 2, Built with React.

# [![Hyvä Themes](https://github.com/hyva-themes/magento2-react-checkout/blob/documentation/docs/images/logo-hyva.svg)](https://hyva.io/)

## hyva-themes/magento2-react-checkout

![Supported Magento Versions][ico-compatibility]

Compatible with Magento 2.3.4 and higher.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation here: https://hyva-themes.github.io/magento2-react-checkout/

## What does it do?
It loads a React Checkout at `[store-url]/hyva/reactcheckout`. When enabled in `hyva_react_checkout/general/enable` it replaces the default checkout.

It depends on these two variables in localstorage:
 - `signin_token` to the `customer` section
 - `cartId` to the `cart` section

For Hyvä Themes or default Magento frontend, `hyva-themes/magento2-graphql-tokens` is needed to add these tokens to the `customerSections`.

## Installation

**Please note:** this checkout is not intended to be installed as *plug-and-play*. It should be considered as a toolbox to build your own checkout based on your needs. A developer with ReactJS knowledge will be required.

Ideally, you would use this checkout with your own version of this module: https://github.com/hyva-themes/magento2-checkout-example
The Checkout Example uses an extension mechanism that allows you to build your own checkout based on this repo.

If you want to install the checkout as a demo or just try it out, install it directly as follows:

1. Install via composer

    Via Packagist:
    ```
    composer require hyva-themes/magento2-react-checkout

    composer require hyva-themes/magento2-react-checkout
    ```
2. Enable module
    ```
